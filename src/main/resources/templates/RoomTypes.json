The room's only exit is a stark doorway, cold iron rod door left swinging on its hinges. Metal shackles hang from the wall, the cuffs rusted and old, but still strong enough to restrain an unruly captive. Moss grows in the cracks between the stone, tracing the outlines in green like a maze of vegetation. In the corner of the room you can see a rough looking cot made from stone and lined with moist sticky hay. A mildewy smell fills the room and stuffs your nostrils as you try to breathe through the musty odour.",
