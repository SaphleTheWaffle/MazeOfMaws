Moss grows in the cracks between the stone, tracing the outlines in green like a maze of vegetation. In the corner of the room you can see a rough looking cot made from stone and lined with moist sticky hay. The smell of mildew fills the room and stuffs your nostrils as you try to breathe through the musty odour.",
